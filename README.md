## Installation

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/BluEyeSkeleton/XPlusC/releases/latest/download/XPlusC.zip) onto your computer. Unzip it and launch `XPlusC.exe` from the unzipped folder.

> **NOTE:** This program was tested on **Windows 11** operating system only, and might not work with other operating systems.

## How to use?

The main window consists of a **question display area, _Shuffle_ button, and _Show Answer_ button**.

| Component             | Description                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Question display area | Integral question and its answer will be shown here. |
| _Shuffle_ button      | Generates another integral question.                 |
| _Show Answer_ button  | Shows the final answer to the question.              |

There are **three** tabs on the menu bar, which are **_Mode_, _Options_, and _Help_**.

| Mode                                 | Description                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Random                               | The program will randomly choose a mode for you.                                 |
| Power Rule (Basic)                   | The most basic integration rule.                                                 |
| Power Rule (Linear)                  | Linear expression raised to the power of _n_.                                    |
| Power Rule (Basic with power of -1)  | This is where `ln` comes into play.                                              |
| Power Rule (Linear with power of -1) | Linear expression raised to the power of _-1_. Again, `ln`.                      |
| Exponent (Euler's number)            | Euler's number (_e_) raised to the power of _x_ or linear expression with _x_.   |
| Exponent (Integer)                   | An integer raised to the power of _x_ or linear expression with _x_.             |
| Trigonometry (Basic)                 | Integral with either `sin` or `cos` function.                                    |
| Trigonometry (Linear)                | Integral with either `sin` or `cos` function, but with linear expression inside. |

| Option                                              | Description                                                                  | Default value |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Prepend numerical coefficient                       | Sets whether if coefficients should appear before _x_.                       | _On_          |
| Include fractional coefficient                      | If set to _On_, fractions are allowed to be used as coefficients and powers. | _Off_         |
| Set maximum integer value for coefficient and power | -                                                                            | _6_           |
| Set minimum integer value for coefficient and power | -                                                                            | _2_           |
